       Specification of Christian's Congestion Control Code (C4)
                   draft-huitema-ccwg-c4-spec-latest

Abstract

   Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control
   algorithm designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media
   over QUIC.  It is designed to drive towards low delays, with good
   support for the "application limited" behavior frequently found when
   using variable rate encoding, and with fast reaction to congestion to
   avoid the "priority inversion" happening when congestion control
   overestimates the available capacity.  The design emphasizes
   simplicity and avoids making too many assumptions about the "model"
   of the network.

1.  Introduction

   Christian's Congestion Control Code (C4) is a congestion control
   algorithm designed to support Real-Time multimedia applications,
   specifically multimedia applications using QUIC [RFC9000] and the
   Media over QUIC transport [I-D.ietf-moq-transport].

   The two main variables describing the state of a flow are the
   "nominal rate" (see Section 3.1) and the "nominal max RTT" (see
   Section 3.2).  C4 organizes the management of the flow through a
   series of states: Initial, during which the first assessment of
   nominal-rate and nominal max RTT are obtained, Recovery in which a

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   flow is stabilized after the Initial or Pushing phase, Cruising
   during which a flow uses the nominal rate, and Pushing during which
   the flow tries to discover if more resource is available -- see
   Section 4.

   C4 divides the duration of the connection in a set of "eras", each
   corresponding to a packet round trip.  Transitions between protocol
   states typically happen at the end of an era, except if the
   transition is forced by a congestion event.

   C4 assumes that the transport stack is capable of signaling events
   such as acknowledgements, RTT measurements, ECN signals or the
   detection of packet losses.  It also assumes that the congestion
   algorithm controls the transport stack by setting the congestion
   window (CWND) and the pacing rate (see Section 5).

   C4 introduces the concept of "sensitivity" (see Section 5.1) to
   ensure that flows using a large amount of bandwidth are more
   "sensitive" to congestion signals than flows using fewer bandwidth,
   and thus that multiple flows sharing a common bottleneck are driven
   to share the resource evenly.

2.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  C4 variables

   In addition to the nomnal rate and the nominal max RTT, C4 maintains
   a set a variables per flow (see Section 3.3) and per era (see
   Section 3.4).

3.1.  Nominal rate

   The nominal rate is an estimate of the bandwidth available to the
   flow.

   On initialization, the nominal rate is set to zero, and default
   values are used when setting the pacing rate and CWND for the flow.

   C4 evaluates the nominal rate after acknowledgements are received
   using the number of bytes acknowledged since the packet was sent
   (bytes_acknowledged) and the time at which the acknowledged packet
   was sent (time_sent), and the current time (current_time), as well as

   maximum transmission rate computed from the current nominal rate and
   the coefficient "alpha" used in the previous era (alpha_previous).
   If the new measurement is larger than the current nominal_rate, we
   increase that rate:

   rate_estimate = min ( nominal_rate*alpha_previous,
       bytes_acknowledged /(current_time - time_sent)
   nominal_rate = max(rate_estimate, nominal_rate)

   Comparing to nominal_rate*alpha_previous protects against
   overestimating the data rate because of transmission jitter.

   The nominal rate is reduced following congestion events, as specified
   in Section 5.

3.2.  Nominal max RTT

   The nominal max RTT is an estimate of the maximum RTT that can occur
   on the path in the absence of queues.  The RTT samples observed for
   the flow are the sum of four components:

   *  the latency of the path

   *  the jitter introduced by processes like link layer contention or
      link layer retransmission

   *  queuing delays caused by competing applications

   *  queuing delays introduced by C4 itself.

   C4's goal is to obtain a estimate of the combination of path latency
   and maximum jitter.  This is done by only taking measurements when C4
   is sending data at a rate below the nominal transmission rate, as
   happens for example in the recovery state.  These measurements will
   happen during the following era.  C4 captures them by recording the
   max RTT for packets sent in that era.  C4 will also progressively
   reduce the value of the nominal max RTT over time, to account for
   changes in network conditions.

   /* on end of era */
   if alpha_previous < 1.0:
       if era_max_rtt > nominal_max_rtt:
           nominal_max_rtt = era_max_rtt
       else:
           nominal_max_rtt =
             (7*nominal_max_rtt + era_max_rtt)/8

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   The decrease over time is tuned so that jitter events will be
   remembered for several of the cruising-pushing-recovery cycles, which
   is enough time for the next jitter event to happen, at least on Wi-Fi
   networks.

3.3.  Global variables

   In addition to the nominal rate and nominal MAX RTT, C4 maintains a
   set of variables tracking the evolution of the flow:

   *  running min RTT, an approximation of the min RTT for the flow,

   *  number of eras without increase (see Section 4.2),

   *  number of successful pushes,

   *  current state of the algorithm, which can be Initial, Recovery,
      Cruising or Pushing.

3.4.  Per era variables

   C4 keeps variables per era:

   era_sequence; /* sequence number of first packet sent in this era */
   alpha_current; /* coefficient alpha used in the current state */
   alpha_previous; /* coefficient alpha used in the previous era */
   era_max_rtt; /* max RTT observed during this era */
   era_min_rtt; /* min RTT observed during this era */

   These variables are initialized at the beginning of the era.

4.  States and Transition

   The state machine for C4 has the following states:

   *  "Initial": the initial state, during which the CWND is set to
      twice the "nominal_CWND".  The connection exits startup if the
      "nominal_cwnd" does not increase for 3 consecutive round trips.
      When the connection exits startup, it enters "recovery".

   *  "Recovery": the connection enters that state after "Initial",
      "pushing", or a congestion detection in a "cruising" state.  It
      remains in that state for at least one roundtrip, until the first
      packet sent in "recovery" is acknowledged.  Once that happens, the
      connection goes back to "startup" if the last 3 pushing attemps
      have resulted in increases of "nominal rate", or enters "cruising"
      otherwise.

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   *  "Cruising": the connection is sending using the "nominal_rate" and
      "nominal_max_rtt" value.  If congestion is detected, the
      connection exits cruising and enters "recovery" after lowering the
      value of "nominal_cwnd".  Otherwise, the connection will remain in
      "cruising" state until at least 4 RTT and the connection is not
      "app limited".  At that point, it enters "pushing".

   *  "Pushing": the connection is using a rate and CWND 25% larger than
      "nominal_rate" and "nominal_CWND".  It remains in that state for
      one round trip, i.e., until the first packet send while "pushing"
      is acknowledged.  At that point, it enters the "recovery" state.

   These transitions are summarized in the following state diagram.

4.1.  Setting pacing rate, congestion window and quantum

   If the nominal rate or the nominal max RTT are not yet assessed, C4
   sets pacing rate, congestion window and pacing quantum to initial
   values:

   *  pacing rate: set to the data rate of the outgoing interface,

   *  congestion window: set to the equivalent of 10 packets,

   *  congestion quantum: set to zero.

   If the nominal rate or the nominal max RTT are both assessed, C4 sets
   pacing rate, and congestion window to values that depends on these
   variables and on a coefficient alpha_current:

   pacing_rate = alpha_current_ * nominal_rate
   cwnd = max (pacing_rate * nominal_max_rtt, 2*MTU)
   quantum = max ( min (cwnd / 4, 64KB), 2*MTU)

   The coefficient alpha for the different states is:

          +==========+==============+===========================+
          | state    | alpha        | comments                  |

          +----------+--------------+---------------------------+

                                  Table 1

4.2.  Initial state

   When the flow is initialized, it enters the Initial state, during
   which it does a first assessment of the "nominal rate" and "nominal
   max RTT".  The coefficient alpha_current is set to 2.  The "nominal
   rate" and "nominal max RTT" are initialized to zero, which will cause
   pacing rate and CWND to be set default initial values.  The nominal
   max RTT will be set to the first assessed RTT value, but is not
   otherwise changed during the initial phase.  The nominal rate is
   updated after receiving acknowledgements, see {#nominal-rate}.

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   C4 will exit the Initial state and enter Recovery if the nominal rate
   does not increase for 3 consecutive eras, omitting the eras for which
   the transmission was "application limited".

   C4 exit the Initial if receiving a congestion signal and the
   following conditions are true:

   1- If the signal is due to "delay", C4 will only exit the initial
   state if the nominal_rate did not increase in the last 2 eras.

   2- If the signal is due to "loss", C4 will only exit the initial
   state if more than 20 packets have been received.

   The restriction on delay signals is meant to prevent spurious exit
   due to delay jitter.  The restriction on loss signals is meant to
   ensure that enough packets have been received to properly assess the
   loss rate.

4.3.  Recovery state

   The recovery state is entered from the Initial or Pushing state, or
   from the Cruising state in case of congestion.  The coefficient
   alpha_current is set to 15/16.  Because the multiplier is lower than
   1, the new value of CWND may well be lower than the current number of
   bytes in transit.  C4 will wait until acknowledgements are received
   and the number of bytes in transit is lower than CWND to send new
   packets.

   The Recovery ends when the first packet sent during that state is
   acknowledged.  That means that acknowledgement and congestion signals
   received during recovery are the consequence of packets sent before.
   C4 assumes that whatever corrective action is required by these
   events will be taken prior to entering recovery, and that events
   arriving during recovery are duplicate of the prior events and can be
   ignored.

   Rate increases are detected when acknowledgements received during
   recovery reflect a successful "push" during the Pushing phase.  The
   prior "Pushing" is considered successful if it did not trigger any
   congestion event, and if the data rate increases sufficiently between
   the end of previous Recovery and the end of this one, with
   sufficiently being defined as:

   *  Any increase if the prior pushing rate (alpha_prior) was 17/16 or
      less,

   *  An increase of at least 1/4th of the expected increase otherwise,
      for example an increase of 1/16th if alpha_previous was 5/4.

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   C4 re-enters "Initial" at the end of the recovery period if the
   evaluation shows 3 successive rate increases without congestion.
   Otherwise, C4 enters cruising.

   Reception of a congestion signal during the Initial phase does not
   cause a change in the nominal_rate or nominal_max_RTT.

4.4.  Cruising state {#c4-cruising }

   The Cruising state is entered from the Recovery state.  The
   coefficient alpha_current is set to 1.

   C4 will normally transition from Cruising state to Pushing state
   after 4 eras.  It will transition to Recovery before that if a
   congestion signal is received.

4.5.  Pushing state

   The Pushing state is entered from the Cruising state.  The
   coefficient alpha_current is set to 5/4 if the previous pushing
   attempt was successful (see Section 4.3), or 17/16 if it was not.

   C4 exits the pushing state after one era, or if a congestion signal
   is received before that.  In an exception to standard congestion
   processing, the reduction in nominal_rate and nominal_max_RTT are not
   applied if the congestion signal is tied to a packet sent during the
   Pushing state.

5.  Handling of congestion signals

   C4 responds to congestion events by reducing the nominal rate, and in
   some condition also reducing the nominal max RTT.  C4 monitors 3
   types of congestion events:

   1.  Excessive increase of measured RTT,

   2.  Excessive rate of packet losses (but not mere Probe Time Out, see
       Section 5.3.1),

   3.  Excessive rate of ECN/CE marks











Huitema, et al.           Expires 11 April 2026                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              C4 Specification                October 2025


   C4 monitors successive RTT measurements and compare them to a
   reference value, defined as the sum of the "nominal max rtt" and a
   "delay threshold".  C4 monitors the arrival of packet losses computes
   a "smoothed error rate", and compares it to a "loss threshold".  When
   the path supports ECN, C4 monitors the arrival of ECN marks and
   computes a "smoothed CE rate", and compares it to a "CE threshold".
   These coefficients depend on the sensitivity coefficient defined in
   Section 5.1.

5.1.  Variable Sensitivity

   The three congestion detection thresholds are function of the
   "sensitivity" coefficient, which increases with the nominal rate of
   the flow.  Flows operating at a low data rate have a low sensitivity
   coefficient and reacts slower to congestion signals than flows
   operating at a higher rate.  If multiple flows share the same
   bottleneck, the flows with higher data rate will detect congestion
   signals and back off faster than flow operating at lower rate.  This
   will drive these flows towards sharing the available resource evenly.

   The sensitivity coefficient varies from 0 to 1, according to a simple
   curve:

   *  set sensitivity to 0 if data rate is lower than 50000B/s

   *  linear interpolation between 0 and 0.92 for values between 50,000
      and 1,000,000B/s.

   *  linear interpolation between 0.92 and 1 for values between
      1,000,000 and 10,000,000B/s.

   *  set sensitivity to 1 if data rate is higher than 10,000,000B/s

   The sensitivity index is then used to set the value of delay and loss
   and CE thresholds.

5.2.  Detecting Excessive Delays

   The delay threshold is function of the nominal max RTT and the
   sensitivity coefficient:

       delay_fraction = 1/16 + (1 - sensitivity)*3/16
       delay_threshold = min(25ms, delay_fraction*nominal_max_rtt)

   A delay congestion signal is detected if:

       rtt_sample > nominal_max_rtt + delay_threshold

5.3.  Detecting Excessive Losses

   C4 maintains an average loss rate, updated for every packet as:

       if packet_is_lost:
           loss = 1
       else:
           loss = 0
       smoothed_loss_rate = (loss + 15*smoothed_loss_rate)/16

   The loss threshold is computed as:

       loss_threshold = 0.02 + 0.50 * (1-sensitivity);

   A loss is detected if the smoothed loss rate is larger than the
   threshold.  In that case, the coefficient beta is set to 1/4.

5.3.1.  Do not react to Probe Time Out

   QUIC normally detect losses by observing gaps in the sequences of
   acknowledged packet.  That's a robust signal.  QUIC will also inject
   "Probe time out" packets if the PTO timeout elapses before the last
   sent packet has not been acknowledged.  This is not a robust
   congestion signal, because delay jitter may also cause PTO timeouts.
   When testing in "high jitter" conditions, we realized that we should
   not change the state of C4 for losses detected solely based on timer,
   and only react to those losses that are detected by gaps in
   acknowledgements.

5.4.  Detecting Excessive CE Marks

   TBD.  The plan is to mimic the L4S specification.

5.5.  Rate Reduction on Congestion

   On entering recovery, C4 reduces the nominal_rate by the factor
   "beta" corresponding to the congestion signal:

       nominal_rate = (1-beta)*nominal_rate

   The coefficient beta differs depending on the nature of the
   congestion signal.  For packet losses, it is set to 1/4, similar to
   the value used in Cubic.

   For delay based losses, it is proportional to the difference between
   the measured RTT and the target RTT divided by the acceptable margin,
   capped to 1/4:

       beta = min(1/4,
                 (rtt_sample - (nominal_max_rtt + delay_threshold)/
                  delay_threshod))

   If the signal is an ECN/CE rate, this is still TBD.  We could use a
   proportional reduction coefficient in line with [RFC9331], but we
   should use the senitivity coefficient to modulate that signal.

6.  Security Considerations

   We do not believe that C4 introduce new security issues.  Or maybe
   there are, such as what happen if applications can be fooled in going
   to fast and overwhelming the network, or going too slow and
   underwhelming the application.  Discuss!

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
