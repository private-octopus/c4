           Design of Christian's Congestion Control Code (C4)
                  draft-huitema-ccwg-c4-design-latest

Abstract

   Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control
   algorithm designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media
   over QUIC.  It is designed to drive towards low delays, with good
   support for the "application limited" behavior frequently found when
   using variable rate encoding, and with fast reaction to congestion to
   avoid the "priority inversion" happening when congestion control
   overestimates the available capacity.  The design emphasizes
   simplicity and avoids making too many assumption about the "model" of
   the network.

1.  Introduction

   Christian's Congestion Control Code (C4) is a new congestion control
   algorithm designed to support Real-Time multimedia applications,
   specifically multimedia applications using QUIC [RFC9000] and the
   Media over QUIC transport [I-D.ietf-moq-transport].  These
   applications require low delays, and often exhibit a variable data
   rate as they alternate high bandwidth requirements when sending
   reference frames and lower bandwith requirements when sending
   differential frames.  We translate that into 3 main goals:

   *  Drive towards low delays (see Section 2),

   *  Support "application limited" behavior (see Section 4),

   *  React quickly to changing network conditions (see Section 3).

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   The design of C4 is inspired by our experience using different
   congestion control algorithms for QUIC, notably Cubic [RFC9438],
   Hystart [HyStart], and BBR [I-D.ietf-ccwg-bbr], as well as the study
   of delay-oriented algorithms such as TCP Vegas [TCP-Vegas] and LEDBAT
   [RFC6817].  In addition, we wanted to keep the algorithm simple and
   easy to implement.

   C4 assumes that the transport stack is capable of signaling to the
   congestion algorithms events such as acknowledgements, RTT
   measurements, ECN signals or the detection of packet losses.  It also
   assumes that the congestion algorithm controls the transport stack by
   setting the congestion window (CWND) and the pacing rate.

   C4 tracks the state of the network by keeping a small set of
   variables, the main ones being the "nominal rate", the "nominal max
   RTT", and the current state of the algorithm.  The details on using
   and tracking the min RTT are discussed in Section 2.

   The nominal rate is the pacing rate corresponding to the most recent
   estimate of the bandwidth available to the connection.  The nominal
   CWND is a congestion window that, if applied, would not cause the
   building of queues and network congestion.  C4 discovers these value
   during the "initial" phase.  C4 will spend most of its time following
   these parameters, i.e., in "cruising" mode.  It will use larger rate
   and CWND during "pushing" periods, to try discover whether the
   network capacity has increased.  If it encounters congestion, C4 will
   reduce the nominal rate and nominal CWND and move to "recovery",
   before returning to cruising.  The design of these mechanisms is
   discussed in Section 3.

   The nominal max RTT is the best estimate of the maximum RTT that can
   occur on the network in the absence of queues.  When we do not
   observe delay jitter, this coincides with the min RTT.  In the
   presence of jitter, it should be the sum of the min RTT and the
   maximum jitter.  C4 will compute a pacing rate as the nominal rate
   multiplied by a coefficient that depends on the state of the
   protocol, and set the CWND for the path to the product of that pacing
   rate by the max RTT.

2.  Studying the reaction to delays

   TODO: we don't actually do that.  But it is important to discuss
   these techniques, and point out the issues.  Discuss why tracking the
   min RTT is problematic.  Rewite the section as a reasoning why this
   is an issue.

   If we want to drive for low delays, the obvious choice is to react to
   delay variations.  Our first design was to use the reaction to delays
   found in congestion control algorithms like TCP Vegas or LEDBAT:

   *  monitor the current RTT and the min RTT

   *  if the current RTT sample exceed the min RTT by more than a preset
      margin, treat that as a congestion signal.

   The "preset margin" is set by default to 10 ms in TCP Vegas and
   LEDBAT.  That was adequate when these algorithms were designed, but
   it can be considered excessive in high speed low latency networks.
   For C4, we set it to the lowest of 1/8th of the min RTT and 25ms.

   The min RTT itself is measured over time.  We know from deployment of
   Hystart that delay based algorithms are very sensitive to an
   underestimation of min RTT, which can be cause for example by delay
   jitter and ACK compression.  Instead of simply retaining the minimum
   of all measurements, we apply filtering.

   After applying filtering, the detection of congestion by comparing
   delays to min RTT plus margin works well, except in two conditions:

   *  if the C4 connection is competing with a another connection that
      does not react to delay variations, such as a connection using
      Cubic,

   *  if the network exhibits a lot of latency jitter, as happens on
      some Wi-Fi networks.

   We also know that if several connection using delay-based algorithms
   compete, the competition is only fair if they all have the same
   estimate of the min RTT.  We handle that by using a "periodic slow
   down" mechanism.

2.1.  Filtering of Delay measurements

   When testing an implementation of Cubic in QUIC in 2019, we noticed
   that delay jitter was causing Hystart to exit early, resulting in
   poor performance for the affected connection (see [Cubic-QUIC-Blog]).
   There was a double effect:

   *  Latency jitter sometimes resulted in measurements exceeding the
      target delay, causing Hystart to exit,

   *  Latency jitter also resulted sometimes in measurements lower than
      the min RTT, causing the delay threshold to be set at an
      excessively low value.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   We corrected the issue by implementing a low pass filter of the the
   delay measurements.  The low pass filter retained the last N
   measurements.  We modified delay tests as follow:

   *  We only considered a measurement as exceeding the delay target if
      all last N measurements exceeded that target,

   *  We only updated the min RTT if the maximum of the last N
      measurements exceeded the min RTT.

   There is of course a tension between the number of samples considered
   (the value N) and the responsiveness of delay-based congestion
   control.  The delay-based congestion notification will only happen
   after N measurements.  This depends on the frequency of
   acknowledgements, which itself depends on configuration parameters of
   the QUIC implementation.  This frequency is itself compromise: too
   frequent ACKs cause too many interruptions and slow down the
   transmission, but spacing ACKs too much means that detection of
   packet losses will be delayed.  QUIC ACK Frequency draft
   [I-D.ietf-quic-ack-frequency] allows sender to specify a maximum
   delay and a maximum number of packets between ACKs, and we can expect
   different implementations to use different parameters.

   In our early implementation, we set N=7, because we assume that we
   will get at least 8 ACKs per RTT most of the time.  We might want to
   reduce that number when the congestion window is small, for example
   smaller than 16 packets, but we have not tested that yet.

2.2.  Managing Competition with Loss Based Algorithms

   Competition between Cubic and a delay based algorithm leads to Cubic
   consuming all the bandwidth and the delay based connection starving.
   This phenomenon force TCP Vegas to only be deployed in controlled
   environments, in which it does not have to compete with TCP Reno
   [RFC6582] or Cubic.

   We handle this competition issue by using a simple detection
   algorithm.  If C4 detect competition with a loss based algorithm, it
   switches to "pig war" mode and stops reacting to changes in delays --
   it will instead only react to packet losses and ECN signals.  In that
   mode, we use another algorithm to detect when the competition has
   ceased, and switch back to the delay responsive mode.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   In our initial deployments, we detect competition when delay based
   congestion notifications leads to CWND and rate reduction for more
   than 3 consecutive RTT.  The assumption is that if the competition
   reacted to delays variations, it would have reacted to the delay
   increases before 3 RTT.  However, that simple test caused many "false
   positive" detections.

   We have refined this test to start the pig war if we have observed 4
   consecutive delay-based rate reductions and the nominal CWND is less
   than half the max nominal CWND observed since the last "initial"
   phase, or if we have observed at least 5 reductions and the nominal
   CWND is less than 4/5th of the max nominal CWND.

   We validated this test by comparing the ratio CWND/MAX_CWND for
   "valid" decisions, when we are simulating a competition scenario, and
   "spurious" decisions, when the "more than 3 consecutive reductions"
   test fires but we are not simulating any competition:

                   +================+=======+==========+
                   | Ratio CWND/Max | valid | spurious |
                   +================+=======+==========+
                   | Average        | 30%   | 75%      |

                                  Table 1

   Our initial exit competition algorithm is simple.  C4 will exit the
   "pig war" mode if the available bandwidth increases.

2.3.  Handling Chaotic Delays

   TODO: maybe start here.  This is why we really want to have rate
   control, but if we have rate control we can use larger windows.

   Some Wi-Fi networks exhibit spikes in latency.  These spikes are
   probably what caused the delay jitter discussed in [Cubic-QUIC-Blog].
   We discussed them in more details in [Wi-Fi-Suspension-Blog].  We are
   not sure about the mechanism behind these spikes, but we have noticed
   that they mostly happen when several adjacent Wi-Fi networks are
   configured to use the same frequencies and channels.  In these
   configurations, we expect the hidden node problem to result in some
   collisions.  The Wi-Fi layer 2 retransmission algorithm takes care of
   these losses, but apparently uses an exponential back off algorithm
   to space retransmission delays in case of repeated collisions.  When
   repeated collisions occur, the exponential backoff mechanism can
   cause large delays.  The Wi-Fi layer 2 algorithm will also try to
   maintain delivery order, and subsequent packets will be queued behind
   the packet that caused the collisions.

   We detect the advent of such "chaotic delay jitter" by computing a
   running estimate of the max RTT.  We measure the max RTT observed in
   each round trip, to obtain the "era max RTT".  We then compute an
   exponentially averaged "nominal max RTT":

   nominal_max_rtt = (7 * nominal_max_rtt + era_max_rtt) / 8;

   If the nominal max RTT is more than twice the min RTT, we set the
   "chaotic jitter" condition.  When that condition is set, we stop
   considering excess delay as an indication of congestion, and we
   change the way we compute the "current CWND" used for the controlled
   path.  Instead of simply setting it to "nominal CWND", we set it to a
   larger value:

   target_cwnd = alpha*nominal_cwnd +
                 (max_bytes_acked - nominal_cwnd) / 2;

   In this formula, alpha is the amplification coefficient corresponding
   to the current state, such as for example 1 if "cruising" or 1.25 if
   "pushing" (see Section 3), and max_bytes_acked is the largest amount
   of bytes in flight that was succesfully acknowledged since the last
   initial phase.

   The increased target_cwnd enables C4 to keep sending data through
   most jitter events.  There is of course a risk that this increased
   value will cause congestion.  We limit that risk by only using half
   the value of max_bytes_ack, and by the setting a conservative pacing
   rate:

   target_rate = alpha*nominal_rate;

   Using the pacing rate that way prevents the larger window to cause
   big spikes in traffic.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   The network conditions can evolve over time.  C4 will keep monitoring
   the nominal max RTT, and will reset the "chaotic jitter" condition if
   nominal max RTT decreases below a threshold of 1.5 times the min RTT.

2.4.  Monitor min RTT

   TODO: we will not in fact track the min RTT.

   Delay based algorithm like CWND rely on a correct estimate of the min
   RTT.  They will naturally discover a reduction in the min RTT, but
   detecting an increase in the max RTT is difficult.  There are known
   failure modes when multiple delay based algortihms compete, in
   particular the "late comer advantage".

   The connections ensure that their min RTT is valid by occasionally
   entering a "slowdown" period, during which they set CWND to half the
   nominal value.  This is similar to the "Probe RTT" mechanism
   implemented in BBR, or the "initial and periodic slowdown" proposed
   as extension to LEDBAT in [I-D.irtf-iccrg-ledbat-plus-plus].  In our
   implementation, the slowdown occurs if more than 5 seconds have
   elapsed since the previous slowdown, or since the last time the min
   RTT was set.

   The measurement of min RTT in the period that follows the slowdown is
   considered a "clean" measurement.  If two consecutive slowdown
   periods are followed by clean measurements larger than the current
   min RTT, we detect an RTT change and reset the connection.  If the
   measurement results in the same value as the previous min RTT, C4
   continue normal operation.

   Some applications exhibit periods of natural slow down.  This is the
   case for example of multimedia applications, when they only send
   differentially encoded frames.  Natural slowdown is detected if an
   application sends less than half the nominal CWND during a period,
   and more than 4 seconds have elapsed since the previous slowdown or
   the previous min RTT update.  The measurement that follows a natural
   slowdown is also considered a clean measurement.

   A slowdown period corresponds to a reduction in offered traffic.  If
   multiple connections are competing for the same bottleneck, each of
   these connections may experience cleaner RTT measurements, leading to
   equalization of the min RTT observed by these connections.

3.  React quickly to changing network conditions

   TODO: only use rate, not CWND.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   Our focus is on maintaining low delays, and thus reacting to delay
   increases as explained in Section 2.  However, only relying on
   increased delays would be a mistake.  Experience with the early
   version of BBR showed that completely ignoring packet losses can lead
   to very unfair competition with Cubic.  The L4S effort is promoting
   the use of ECN feedback by network elements (see [RFC9331]), which
   could well end up detecting congestion and queues more precisely than
   the monitoring of end-to-end delays.  C4 will thus detect changing
   network conditions by monitoring 3 congestion control signals:

   1.  Excessive increase of measured RTT (except in pig war mode),

   2.  Excessive rate of packet losses (but not mere Probe Time Out, see
       Section 3.1),

   3.  Excessive rate of ECN/CE marks

   If any of these signals is detected, C4 enters a "recovery" state.
   On entering recovery, C4 reduces the nominal_CWND and nominal_rate by
   a factor "beta":

       // on congestion detected:
       nominal_CWND = (1-beta)*nominal_CWND
       nominal_rate = (1-beta)*nominal_rate

   The cofficient beta differs depending on the nature of the congestion
   signal.  For packet losses, it is set to 1/4, similar to the value
   used in Cubic.  For delay based losses, it is proportional to the
   difference between the measured RTT and the target RTT divided by the
   acceptable margin, capped to 1/4.  If the signal is an ECN/CE rate,
   we may use a proportional reduction coefficient in line with
   [RFC9331], again capped to 1/4.

   During the recovery period, target CWND and pacing rate are set to
   the new values of "nominal CWND" and "nominal rate".  The recovery
   period ends when the first packet sent after entering recovery is
   acknowledged.  Congestion signals are processed when entering
   recovery; further signals are ignored until the end of recovery.

   Network conditions may change for the better or for the worse.
   Worsening is detected through congestion signals, but increases can
   only be detected by trying to send more data and checking whether the
   network accepts it.  Different algorithms have done two ways:
   pursuing regular increases of CWND until congestion finally occurs,
   like for example the "congestion avoidance" phase of TCP RENO; or
   periodically probe the network by sending at a higher rate, like the
   Probe Bandwidth mechanism of BBR.  C4 adopt the periodic probing
   approach, in particular because it is a better fit for variable rate
   multimedia applications (see details in Section 4).

3.1.  Do not react to Probe Time Out

   QUIC normally detect losses by observing gaps in the sequences of
   acknowledged packet.  That's a robust signal.  QUIC will also inject
   "Probe time out" packets if the PTO timeout elapses before the last
   sent packet has not been acknowledged.  This is not a robust
   congestion signal, because delay jitter may also cause PTO timeouts.
   When testing in "high jitter" conditions, we realized that we should
   not change the state of C4 for losses detected solely based on timer,
   and only react to those losses that are detected by gaps in
   acknowledgements.

3.2.  Update the Nominal Rate and CWND after Pushing

   TODO: only the nominal rate.

   C4 configures the transport with a larger rate and CWND than the
   nominal CWND during "pushing" periods.  The peer will acknowledge the
   data sent during these periods in the round trip that followed.

   When we receive an ACK for a newly acknowledged packet number N, we
   compute the number of bytes acknowledged between the acknowledgement
   received before N was sent and the acknowledgement of the last packet
   of this period.  We use that number to compute the observed data rate
   as:

   observed_rate = bytes_acked / max(observed_rtt, min_rtt)

   The observed RTT is computed as the delay between the time the
   acknowledged packet was sent and the time at which it was received.
   Using max(rtt_sample, min_rtt) in this formula is a precaution
   against under-estimation of this delay due to for example to delay
   jitter or ack compression.

   We use the observed rate to compute a "corrected" value of the bytes

   corrected_bytes_acked = observed_rate*min_rtt

   We then use these values to update the nominal rate, nominal CWND,
   max CWND and max bytes acked state variables:

   nominal_rate = max(observed_rate, nominal_rate)
   nominal_CWND = max(corrected_bytes_acked, nominal_CWND)
   max_CWND = max(nominal_CWND, max_CWND)
   max_bytes_acked = max(bytes_acked,max_bytes_acked)

   This strategy is effectively a form of "make before break".  The
   pushing only increase the rate and CWND by a fraction of the nominal
   values, and only lasts for one round trip.  That limited increase is
   not expected to increase the size of queues by more than a small
   fraction of the bandwidth*delay product.  It might cause a slight
   increase of the measured RTT for a short period, or perhaps cause
   some ECN signalling, but it should not cause packet losses -- unless
   C4 is in "pig war" mode.  If there was no extra capacity available,
   C4 does not increase the nominal CWND and the connection continues
   with the previous value.

3.3.  Driving for fairness

   TODO: move to appendix, unproven.  Consider that Max RTT is in fact a
   shared variable, implicitly tracked by Cubic.

   The duration of cruising is expressed as a number of bytes.  This
   number of bytes is computed with two goals:

   *  The potential increase of 25% divided by the total number of bytes
      sent during recovery, cruising and pushing should match the
      aggressiveness of RENO when operating at low bandiwdth (lower than
      34 Mbps).

   *  Connection using large values of CWND should be less aggressive
      than those with smaller value, so that all connections sharing the
      same bottleneck should eventually converge to similar CWND values.

   We achieve those two goals using the following formula:

       target = nominal_CWND*7* (1 +
                (max(11, min(28, log2(nominal_CWND))) - 11)/(28 - 11))

   The constants 7, 11 and 28 in the formula are explained as follow:

   *  The number 7 corresponds to 7 RTT.  Depending of bandwidth, the
      connection will remain between 7 and 14 RTT in cruise state.

   *  The value 11 corresponds to 2048 bytes.  We use that as a minimum.

   *  The value 28 corresponds to 268,435,456 bytes, e.g., a connection
      at 10 Gbps operating with an RTT a little above 200ms.

   For example, assuming an RTT of 50 ms, we will see cruising duration
   in RTT varying with the bandwidth in bps as:

   We could have expressed this in fractions of RTT instead of number of
   bytes, which might be more fair for application limited connection.

   We could also compute these fractions based on the measured
   bandwidth, "nominal CWND" divided by "target RTT", which would make
   fairness less dependent on path RTT. we did not, because TCP RENO's
   mechanism are strictly based on CWND size, and thus fairness requires
   using the same criteria.

3.4.  Cascade of Increases

   We sometimes encounter networks in which the available bandwidth
   changes rapidly.  For example, when a competing connection stops, the
   available capacity may double.  With low Earth orbit satellite
   constellations (LEO), it appears that ground stations constantly
   check availability of nearby satellites, and switch to a different
   satellite every 10 or 15 seconds depending on the constellation (see
   [ICCRG-LEO]), with the bandwidth jumping from 10Mbps to 65Mbps.

   Because we aim for fairness with RENO or Cubic, the cycle of
   recovery, cruising and pushing will only result in slow increases
   increases, maybe 25% after 10 RTT.  This means we would only double
   the bandwidth after about 40 RTT, or increase from 10 to 65 Mbps
   after almost 200 RTT -- by which time the LEO station might have
   connected to a different orbiting satellite.  To go faster, we
   implement a "cascade": if three successive pushings all result in
   increases of the nominal rate, C4 will reenter the "startup" mode,
   during which each RTT can result in a 100% increase of rate and CWND.

4.  Supporting Application Limited Connections

   C4 is specially designed to support multimedia applications, which
   very often operate in application limited mode.  After testing and
   simulations of application limited applications, we incorporated a
   number of features.

   The first feature is the design decision to only lower the nominal
   rate and CWND if congestion is detected.  This is in contrast with
   the BBR design, in which the estimate of bottleneck bandwidth is also
   lowered if the bandwidth measured after a "probe bandwidth" attempt
   is lower than the current estimate while the connection was not
   "application limited".  We found that detection of the application
   limited state was somewhat error prone.  Occasional errors end up
   with a spurious reduction of the estimate of the bottleneck
   bandwidth.  These errors can accumulate over time, causing the
   bandwidth estimate to "drift down", and the multimedia experience to
   suffer.  Our strategy of only reducing the nominal values in reaction
   to congestion notifications much reduces that risk.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   The second feature is the "make before break" nature of the rate and
   CWND updates discussed in Section 3.2.  This reduces the risk of
   using rate and CWND that are too large and would cause queues or
   losses, and thus make C4 a good choice for multimedia applications.

   C4 adds two more features to handle multimedia applications well:
   coordinated pushing (see Section 4.1), and variable pushing rate (see
   Section 4.2).

4.1.  Coordinated Pushing

   As stated in Section 3.3, the connection will remain in "cruising"
   state for a specified interval, and then move to "pushing".  This
   works well when the connection is almost saturating the network path,
   but not so well for a media application that uses little bandwidth
   most of the time, and only needs more bandwidth when it is refreshing
   the state of the media encoders and sending new "reference" frames.
   If that happens, pushing will only be effective if the pushing
   interval coincides with the sending of these reference frames.  If
   pushing happens during an application limited period, there will be
   no data to push with and thus no chance of increasing the nominal
   rate and CWND.  If the reference frames are sent outside of a pushing
   interval, the rate and CWND will be kept at the nominal value.

   To break that issue, one could imagine sending "filler" traffic
   during the pushing periods.  We tried that in simulations, and the
   drawback became obvious.  The filler traffic would sometimes cause
   queues and packet losses, which degrade the quality of the multimedia
   experience.  We could reduce this risk of packet losses by sending
   redundant traffic, for example creating the additional traffic using
   a forward error correction (FEC) algorithm, so that individual packet
   losses are immediately corrected.  However, this is complicated, and
   FEC does not always protect against long batches of losses.

   C4 uses a simpler solution.  If the time has come to enter pushing,
   it will check whether the connection is "application limited", which
   is simply defined as testing whether the application send a "nominal
   CWND" worth of data during the previous interval.  If it is, C4 will
   remain in cruising state until the application finally sends more
   data, and will only enter the the pushing state when the last period
   was not application limited.

4.2.  Variable Pushing Rate

   C4 tests for available bandwidth at regular pushing intervals (see
   Section 3.3), during which the rate and CWND is set at 25% more than
   the nominal values.  This mimics what BBR is doing, but may be less
   than ideal for real time applications.  When in pushing state, the
   application is allowed to send more data than the nominal CWND, which
   causes temporary queues and degrades the experience somewhat.  On the
   other hand, not pushing at all would not be a good option, because
   the connection could end up stuck using only a fraction of the
   available capacity.  We thus have to find a compromise between
   operating at low capacity and risking building queues.

   We manage that compromise by adopting a variable pushing rate:

   *  If pushing at 25% did not result in a significant increase of the
      nominal rate, the next pushing will happen at 6.25%

   *  If pushing at 6.25% did result in some increase of the nominal
      CWIN, the next pushing will happen at 25%, otherwise it will
      remain at 6.25%

   As explained in Section 3.4, if three consecutive pushing attempts
   result in significant increases, C4 detects that the underlying
   network conditions have changed, and will reenter the startup state.

   The "significant increase" mentioned above is a matter of debate.
   Even if capacity is available, increasing the send rate by 25% does
   not always result in a 25% increase of the acknowledged rate.  Delay
   jitter, for example, may result in lower measurement.  We initially
   computed the threshold for detecting "significant" increase as 1/2 of
   the increase in the sending rate, but multiple simulation shows that
   was too high and and caused lower performance.  We now set that
   threshold to 1/4 of the increase in he sending rate.

4.3.  Pushing rate and Cascades

   The choice of a 25% push rate was motivated by discussions of BBR
   design.  Pushing has two parallel functions: discover the available
   capacity, if any; and also, push back against other connections in
   case of competition.  Consider for example competition with Cubic.
   The Cubic connection will only back off if it observes packet losses,
   which typically happen when the bottleneck buffers are full.  Pushing
   at a high rate increases the chance of building queues, overfilling
   the buffers, causing losses, and thus causing Cubic to back off.
   Pushing at a lower rate like 6.25% would not have that effect, and C4
   would keep using a lower share of the network.  This is why we will
   always push at 25% in the "pig war" mode.

Internet-Draft                  C4 Design                 September 2025


   The computation of the interval between pushes is tied to the need to
   compete nicely, and follows the general idea that the average growth
   rate should mimic that of RENO or Cubic in the same circumstances.
   If we pick a lower push rate, such as 6.25% or maybe 12.5%, we might
   be able to use shorter intervals.  This could be a nice compromise:
   in normal operation, push frequently, but at a low rate.  This would
   not create large queues or disturb competing connections, but it will
   let C4 discover capacity more quickly.  Then, we could use the
   "cascade" algorithm to push at a higher rate, and then maybe switch
   to startup mode if a lot of capacity is available.  This is something
   that we intend to test, but have not implemented yet.

5.  State Machine

   TODO: we do not need the slowdown and checking states.

   The state machine for C4 has the following states:

   *  "startup": the initial state, during which the CWND is set to
      twice the "nominal_CWND".  The connection exits startup if the
      "nominal_cwnd" does not increase for 3 consecutive round trips.
      When the connection exits startup, it enters "recovery".

   *  "recovery": the connection enters that state after "startup",
      "pushing", or a congestion detection in a "cruising" state.  It
      remains in that state for at least one roundtrip, until the first
      packet sent in "discovery" is acknowledged.  Once that happens,
      the connection enters "slowdown" if no "slowdown" has been
      experienced for 5 seconds, or goes back to "startup" if the last 3
      pushing attemps have resulted in increases of "nominal CWND", or
      enters "cruising" otherwise.

   *  "cruising": the connection is sending using the "nominal_rate" and
      "nominal_cwnd" value.  If congestion is detected, the connection
      exits cruising and enters "recovery" after lowering the value of
      "nominal_cwnd".  If after a roundtrip the application sent fewer
      than 1/2 of "nominal_cwnd", and if the last "slowdown" occured
      more than 4 seconds ago, the connection moves to the "checking"
      state.  Otherwise, the connection will remain in "cruising" state
      until a sufficient number of bytes have been acknowledged, and the
      connection is not "app limited".  At that point, it enters
      "pushing".

   *  "pushing": the connection is using a rate and CWND 25% larger than
      "nominal_rate" and "nominal_CWND".  It remains in that state for
      one round trip, i.e., until the first packet send while "pushing"
      is acknowledged.  At that point, it enters the "recovery" state.

   *  "slowdown": the connection is using rate and CWND set to 1/2 of
      the nominal values.  After one round trip, it exits "slowdown" and
      enters "checking".

   *  "checking": after a forced or natural slowdown, the connection
      enters the checking state.  It is sending using rate and CWND set
      to the nominal values.  The connection remains in checking state
      for one round trip.  After that round trip, it goes back to
      "cruising" if the lowest RTT measured during the round trip or the
      previous checking state is lower than or equal to the current min
      RTT.  If not, if the lowest RTT measured during two consecutive
      slowdown periods is higher than the min RTT, it resets the min RTT
      to the last measurement and reenters "startup".

   These transitions are summarized in the following state diagram.
